Responsive-Web-Design-Template
==============================

Adobe InDesign file for creating wireframes and page designs across 320, 768, 1024, &amp; 1200 px breakpoints. Paragraph and character text styles included. Scalable for small and large sites. 

Built from Bootstrap 3 template from https://github.com/morewings/Twitter-Bootstrap-Indesign-template/blob/master/layout.indd, using Bootstrap styles and elements, but enough to get started and design a complete product.
